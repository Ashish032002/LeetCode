Consider my project code,

I want to make this project as api,  I need the endpoints so that I can raise a request to devops team for cluster access. So restructure my code folder accordingly so that I can push it to gitlab and raise cluster allocation request



Basically what I wanted frop api is 

   - Input will be a single address with address1, address2, address3, city, state, pincode, country fields and I'll validate  it using our logic and give .json format as output according the the demo.json file I've shared.

   - The multiple address validation using .xl sheet we'll be doing locally not using the api so that remains same 



And for product my database will be postgres in alloydb



For api creation I want to use fastapi and for connecting with server I'll be using Cloud Run.
